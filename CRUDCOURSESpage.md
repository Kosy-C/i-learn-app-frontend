## As a tutor, i want to be able to add, update and delete courses so that I can render my services.
## Design page for tutor to create, update and delete courses
## The page should have a little form on top where a tutor can upload a course. The form should have an image field, course name tutor name and a field for the price of the course. There should be a button for "upload course" or "schedule time" where a tutor can either upload his course a pdf or schedule when he will be available.After tutor adds a course, there should be a table below the form where the courses are listed. There should be an edit and delete button. The edit button should put all the details of the course back to the form where the tutor can update the course.The table should be paginated.
## The page should be responsive and should work on all devices.
## The page should be accessible to only tutors.
